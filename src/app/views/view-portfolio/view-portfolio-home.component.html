            <h4 class="h4 color-darker-gray bold spacing-top--large">About Me</h4>
            <div class="paragraph color-darker-gray">I was born in Bari, Southern Italy, on May
              19th, 1992. I attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome in 2011, where I started to elaborate my interest
              in photography and graphic arts on a deep level. In 2017 I studied in Barcelona, where I developed my
              knowledge in coding and I approached the Hi-tech's world working as a Front-End Developer. Meantime I
              never stopped working on my photography and graphic art interests.</div>
            <h3 class="paragraph bold color-darker-gray spacing-top--large">Because of my background
              which allow me to be very sensitive to design details, typography and photography I'm constantly improving
              my Autodidact Creative Developer's and UI Developer knowledge also because I have a serious passion for
              and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.</h3>
